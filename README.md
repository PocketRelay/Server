This implementation of Pocket Relay is still under active development. See the [Kotlin Server (https://github.com/PocketRelay/ServerKotlin)](https://github.com/PocketRelay/ServerKotlin)
for a working usable implementation

> This is in very early but active development expect changes to be reflected here

## Early Development
This implementation of PocketRelay is in early development and lacks many of the
features present in the [Kotlin Server (https://github.com/PocketRelay/ServerKotlin)](https://github.com/PocketRelay/ServerKotlin) however it is being actively developed and constantly becoming closer to a usable server.
