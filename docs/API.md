# Token API ðŸŸ¢

Some routes are protected and require a Token from the tokens API. See
Create Token for information on creating a token. After generating a token
provide it as the X-Token header on future requests

## Create Token

This route is for creating authentication tokens for use throughout the rest of the API. These tokens will expire after 24 hours and will need to be created again when
that happens.

### Example Request

```http
POST /api/token
```

The request body contains the username and password that are used in the server 
configuration file

```json 
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
}
```

### Success Response

The response contains the "token" field which is the token to use in the X-Token header for the other requests.
The "expiry_time" field is the unix time stamp in seconds of when the token will become invalid.

```json
{
    "token": "Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh",
    "expiry_time": 1669344878
}
```

### Error Responses 

| Status Code      | Body                | Meaning                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 401 Unauthorized | invalid credentials | The username or password was incorrect |



## Validate Token

This route is for validating existing token to check whether the token is still a valid
token or if a new one needs to be generated.

### Example Request

```http
GET /api/token?token=Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh
```

The query value of token is the token to check the validity of 

### Valid Token Response

When the token is valid the "valid" field will be true and the unix time in seconds
when the token expires will be the "expiry_time" field
```json 
{
    "valid": true,
    "expiry_time": 1669345922
}
```

### Invalid Token Response

When a token is invalid the "valid" field is false and the "expiry_time" is null

```json
{
    "valid": false,
    "expiry_time": null
}
```

## Delete Token

This route is for deleting tokens to make them invalid before the expiry time 
is reached. Useful for logging out etc.

### Example Request

```http
DELETE /api/token
```

The request body contains the username and password that are used in the server 
configuration file

```json 
{
    "token": "Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh",
}
```

### Success Response

This request will always succeed returning the 200 OK status code so the
result of this endpoint can always be ignored




# Server API ðŸŸ 

This API is for retrieving information about the server. This includes the verison and the ports
and server types for each of the sub servers

## Get 

```
GET /api/server
```

Simple get request with no paramaters. This route is used internally by the Client tool to ensure
that a server is actually a Pocket Relay server.

### Response

The "version" field is the server version and the "services" field contains a list of each of
the servers running under Pocket Relay along with their ports and the type of server

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "services": [
        {
            "name": "Redirector Server",
            "port": 42127,
            "type": "BlazeSecure"
        },
        {
            "name": "Main Server",
            "port": 14219,
            "type": "Blaze"
        },
        {
            "name": "HTTP Server",
            "port": 80,
            "type": "HTTP"
        }
    ]
}
```
