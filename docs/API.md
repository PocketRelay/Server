# Dynamic Paths

Certain ruotes contain dynamically matched paths such as /api/players/:player_id matched portions of paths start with `:` when you see part of a path starting with `:` you should
replace this part of the URL with a specific value


# Token API ðŸŸ¢

Some routes are protected and require a Token from the tokens API. See
Create Token for information on creating a token. After generating a token
provide it as the X-Token header on future requests

## Create Token

This route is for creating authentication tokens for use throughout the rest of the API. These tokens will expire after 24 hours and will need to be created again when
that happens.

### Example Request

```http
POST /api/token
```

The request body contains the username and password that are used in the server 
configuration file

```json 
{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
}
```

### Success Response

The response contains the "token" field which is the token to use in the X-Token header for the other requests.
The "expiry_time" field is the unix time stamp in seconds of when the token will become invalid.

```json
{
    "token": "Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh",
    "expiry_time": 1669344878
}
```

### Error Responses 

| Status Code      | Body               | Meaning                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 401 Unauthorized | InvalidCredentials | The username or password was incorrect |



## Validate Token

This route is for validating existing token to check whether the token is still a valid
token or if a new one needs to be generated.

### Example Request

```http
GET /api/token?token=Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh
```

The query value of token is the token to check the validity of 

### Valid Token Response

When the token is valid the "valid" field will be true and the unix time in seconds
when the token expires will be the "expiry_time" field
```json 
{
    "valid": true,
    "expiry_time": 1669345922
}
```

### Invalid Token Response

When a token is invalid the "valid" field is false and the "expiry_time" is null

```json
{
    "valid": false,
    "expiry_time": null
}
```

## Delete Token

This route is for deleting tokens to make them invalid before the expiry time 
is reached. Useful for logging out etc.

### Example Request

```http
DELETE /api/token
```

The request body contains the username and password that are used in the server 
configuration file

```json 
{
    "token": "Tn1RjdQr8Ftrjp1PtED3XRFfKtfcoI6gSdn4F7gyFmmbfCST8aIdLxDWycdChZAh",
}
```

### Success Response

This request will always succeed returning the 200 OK status code so the
result of this endpoint can always be ignored




# Server API ðŸŸ 

This API is for retrieving information about the server. This includes the verison and the ports
and server types for each of the sub servers

## Get 

```
GET /api/server
```

Simple get request with no paramaters. This route is used internally by the Client tool to ensure
that a server is actually a Pocket Relay server.

### Response

The "version" field is the server version and the "services" field contains a list of each of
the servers running under Pocket Relay along with their ports and the type of server

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "services": [
        {
            "name": "Redirector Server",
            "port": 42127,
            "type": "BlazeSecure"
        },
        {
            "name": "Main Server",
            "port": 14219,
            "type": "Blaze"
        },
        {
            "name": "HTTP Server",
            "port": 80,
            "type": "Http"
        }
    ]
}
```


# Players API ðŸ”‘ðŸ”µ

This API is for listing players in the database through paginated results or direcly inspecting
the details for a specific player such as their classes, characters, and galaxy at war data.

> This API is likely to have additional POST routes for updating players, characters, classes, and
> galaxy at war data.

## Get Players

```
GET /api/players?offset=0&count=20
```

The query paramater offset is the page offset and the count is the number of players to include
on each page. Offset 1 & Count = 20 = Skip first 20 row and return next 20 rows.


> Omitting the count query parameter will default to 20 players

### Response

The "players" field contains the list of players within the offset and count. The "more" field determines whether there are more players at the next offset value.
The "offset" field contains the current offset page provided by the query and the "count" is the count expected by the query (The count is NOT the number of players returned)

```json
{
    "players": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "email": "test@test.com",
            "display_name": "test@test.com",
            "origin": false,
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "email": "test1@test.com",
            "display_name": "test1@test.com",

# Leaderboard API ðŸŸ¢

API for accessing the leaderboards stored within the server. (Leaderboards are cached internally for 1 hour both for the API and for the in game leaderboard)

## Leaderboard Keys

The following table is the available leaderboard keys that can be used as the :name route path to decide
which leaderboard to obtain entires from

| Name | Description                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| n7   | Leaderboard ranked on the N7 Rating of each player          |
| cp   | Leaderboard ranked on Challenge point count  of each player |

These keys are used by both of the leaderboard endpoints

## List Leaderboard

```http
GET /api/leaderboard/:name?count=20&offset=0
```
This route allows you to retrieve a specific leaderboard. Responses are paginated

### Query Paramaters

| Key    | Optional | Description                                                                   |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| offset | Yes      | Optional offset parameter to offset the current page (start = offset * count) |

> in a paginated way instead of querying all 255 entries

### Response

The "entries" field contains all the leaderboard entries at the current offset which is at most the provided
count. The "more" field contains whether there are more entires at the next offset value which can be used to 
determine whether a next page is available for pagination

```json
{
    "entries": [
        {
            "player_id": 3,
